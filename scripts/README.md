## Scripts Overview

This folder contains the main analysis scripts used in the project.

### R Script
- **`climate_regression_script.R`**  
  This script performs the econometric analysis of banks’ CET1 capital ratios around major climate policy milestones.  
  It implements difference-in-differences regressions and visualizes CET1 dynamics across European countries.

### Python Script
- **`climate_python_analysis.py`**  
  This script constructs a quarterly bank-level panel dataset and analyzes balance-sheet dynamics.  
  It focuses on asset growth, leverage adjustments, and profitability (ROE) to understand how banks adapt their capital structure in response to climate transition pressures.


### SAS Scripts
- (In progress) Bank-level heterogeneity and long-horizon dynamics.
